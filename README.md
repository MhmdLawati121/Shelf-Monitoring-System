# Shelf Monitoring System

This project, developed by two Computer Systems and Network Engineering students as part of their Embedded Vision Systems coursework, aims to streamline the process of monitoring expiration dates on shelf items.
Overview

The Shelf Monitoring System utilizes QR code scanning to keep track of item expiration dates, alerting users when items are nearing expiry. Originally designed and optimized for Raspberry Pi, it's adaptable to various devices, offering flexibility in implementation.
Key Features
- **Expiration Date Monitoring**: The system scans QR codes to identify items and tracks their expiration dates.
- **User Alerts**: Notifies users when items are approaching their expiration dates, ensuring timely action.
- **Platform Compatibility**: While optimized for Raspberry Pi, the system can be deployed on other Linux devices.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Shelf Monitoring System:

- **Clone the Repository**: Download the project repository to your local machine.
- **Setup Directory Structure**: Create a folder named src within the project directory.
- **Organize Resources**: Move warning images into the src folder and add an image of the shelf without items.
- **Capture Shelf Data**: Connect a camera or record a video of the shelf to be monitored.
- **Run the System**: Execute the code to initiate the monitoring process.
