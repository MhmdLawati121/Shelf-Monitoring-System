# Shelf-Monitoring-System

This project was created by two computer systems and network engineering students as part of their coursework for the course: Embedded Vision Systems

## Functionality

This project monitors the expiration dates of any items on a shelf by scanning a QR code and notifying the user once items are close to expiry. Designed and optimized for usage on a Raspberry Pi, however, it can run on any other device.

The project was created and tested only on Linux devices.

## Usage

- Clone the repository.
- Create a folder named `src`.
- Move the warning images into the `src` folder.
- Get an image of the shelf without any items and place it in the `src` folder.
- Connect a camera or record a video of the shelf to be monitored.
- Run the code!
